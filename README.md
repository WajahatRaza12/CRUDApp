# React CRUD Application 

This repository contains a React CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that allows users to manage data through a user-friendly interface. The application is built using React, and it utilizes various libraries and tools to streamline the development process.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start:dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
The npm run start:dev script is a convenient command that allows developers to concurrently run multiple processes for the application during the development phase. This script is often used when working on projects that require both the frontend and backend components to run simultaneously. By utilizing the concurrently package, this command initiates the execution of two or more scripts in parallel, streamlining the development workflow.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
